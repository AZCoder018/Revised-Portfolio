      <img src="assets/images/Archie_cigar.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Jason Meadows">

      <p class="bio">I am a former attorney from New Jersey, where I practiced law for 8 years. 
        In 2017, I moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to live and work among family and friends in the area.
        Currently, I am enrolled in the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp. 
        I am scheduled to earn my Certificate in Full Stack Web Development in late July of 2018.</p>  

      <p class="bio">Although I am being trained as a full stack developer, I am particularly focused on
        working with React, Java, JavaScript, MySQL, and MongoDB. I also have a strong interest in quality assurance 
        and product testing. </p>
        
      <p class="bio"> My experience and thoroughness as an attorney, combined with my web development skills, 
        would make me a great asset to any company that builds and maintains applications and websites 
        involving, among other areas, legal research, legal self-help, business research, risk management, and cyber-security.</p>
